<h1>PROBER SCRAN!</h1>
<p>To build the perfect dish which qualifies as scran it all comes down to how quickly it can be put together and how easy it is to eat, while still being enjoyable. The dish of today will be <strong>NACHOS.</strong></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A fuck load of tortilla chips.</li>
  <li>A lot of scranable shredded cheese.</li>
  <li>Pre-cooked chicken strips or minced beef (for those wanting a greater challenge).</li>
  <li>Jalapenos (if you'd like it spicy).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>    
<ol>
  <li>Grab a "non-stick" tray and unload some of those tortilla chips into it.</li>
  <li>When the bottom of the tray is filled with the chips then spread a good amount of the cheese on top of the chips.</li>
<li> Keep doing that alternately until all of the chips are used or until the tray is almost filled.</li>
<li>Then put your choice of meat and the jalapenos on top of the top layer of chips and cover it with plenty of cheese.</li>
<li>At last put it into a pre-heated oven at 200 degrees and take them out when the cheese is melted, approximately after 15-20 minutes.</li>
